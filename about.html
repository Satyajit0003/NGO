                <hr>
                <p>Chariti was initiated in 2002 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to the society.
                    They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning
                    who has propagated that “sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems…” and corporate 
                    leaders can't expect governments to solve them alone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What triggered these thoughts was the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1990's which brought with it immense
                    opportunities. Business revived, and India became not just a market, but also an investment prospect for the developed
                    world. Disposable incomes and early settlements became a living reality for the working middle-class. For the first time
                    in India, professionals could think beyond making a living, and contribute towards the society.</p>
                <div class="stories-image"></div>
                <br>
                <p>Fuelled with enthusiasm, Chariti founders gave a shape to their dream, and Chariti was born. Over the last two decades, 
                    Chariti has evolved as a sustainable Indian social institution - committed to do real work on the ground, and make the 
                    society and businesses inclusive in the process of bringing change.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On our way, we had to make many difficult choices and constantly innovate - whether it was choosing to work on the ground
                    through a service-delivery approach, practicing management principles and adopting a business-like approach in the development
                    sector, creating a unique resource modeling keeping businesses at the centre, or promoting the concept of civic driven change.
                    Yes, we almost always took the road less travelled, and as they say, that has made all the difference!</p>

                            We also handhold and build capacities of these organizations, focusing on achieving scalability and sustainability,

                            engagement for a wider and sustained outcome. While working in remote rural areas, we realized that an intensive on-ground 
                            intervention is needed, which might be beyond the capacity of community based organizations and hence, we directly implement 
                            such projects, liaising with local community stakeholders for better social return on investment.</p>
